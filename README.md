## This repository consists of two DBMS projects:

### Analysis of Bird Strikes on Aircrafts
Built a database that can be used to analyze bird strikes on aircraft. 
For an existing data set from the FAA [1] (BirdStrikesData.csv in the repository), built a logical data model, a relational schema, realize the relational schema in MySQL/MariaDB, loaded data into the database, executed SQL queries, a finally performed analysis of the data.

### Using Pubmed Data from XML, Build a Database for Data Mining
Extracted data from an XML document and then stored the data relationally in a SQLite database. This database represents a "transactional" database. 
Then extracted data from the transactional database and created an "analytical" database using a star schema in MySQL. 
Finally, queried facts from the MySQL analytical database. Connections made to two different databases simultaneously which is a common occurrence in practice.
